# G3PO 

**G3PO is a software used to analyze genetic code and make observations based on Machine Learning algorithms and analyzing past data**

This can be used to predict a number of things, with the main focus on diseases caused from viruses. This ises an unique approach to the data training by using the shapes of viruses and their target organisms to predict how likely a virus is to cause harm to a human being.
